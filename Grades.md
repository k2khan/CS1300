		A-/B+   Good use of the Layer in creating an animal class, and the dance() behavior is great, but it would have been nice to see another method or two demonstrating additional higher-level Frog concepts through animation and graphics, such as croak() or hop(), or perhaps having adding temporary text bubbles to the Layer to mimic talking between the Frogs.

# Basic program to find inverted pairs, and reverses the DNA sequencing between them
# Asks input from the user to enter a DNA sequence and also a pattern (inverted pair)
# Uses string splicing and conditional statements (if, elif else)
# Prints out the mutated string, with the string in between the inverted pairs reversed

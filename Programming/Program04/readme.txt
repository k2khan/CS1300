This interest calculator will ask you to select an interest rate,
followed by a principal value. It will then calculate and display the
principal, interest rate, and balance after one year. You will then be
invited to execute the process again or terminate.

The greeting() function returns the greeting that states what this interest calculator does.

The getPrincipal() function lets the user input a principal for which the interest will be calculated.

The getRate() function gives the user some options of what interest rate to select.

The computeBalance() function computes the balance of the account by using the principal and rate.

The monthlyBalance() function computes the balance of the account for each month.

The displayResults() function displays the final results of the calculations. Everything is formatted accordingly.

The askYesNo() function asks whether the user wants to repeat the interest calculator.
